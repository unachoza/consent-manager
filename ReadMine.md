## Documentation 

### My Process
First things first, read the directions, twice. Then go through all the fies, keep notes if files system is intuitive or not (potential to reorgize). Find provided functions and understand them. 

Second thing. I built "Accept" and "Deny" buttons because they were easy and I wanted a shot of confidence.

Third, make sure I understand what a module is and how it is different from a react component.
